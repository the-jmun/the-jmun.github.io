            <h2 class="reveal">Letter From The Secretrait </h2>
            <p class="reveal"> Greetings, <br>
                We are delighted to invite you to the Tenth Edition of Jaipuria Model United Nations, From 14th-16th
                July, 2022. This edition of JMUN promises an exhilarating experience polished and accumulated over
                the past ten years. A decade ago, this festival was celebrated for the first time ever while we were
                busy being amazed by the dynamics of the third grade, blissfully unaware of the birth of an event
                that would transform each of us as individuals. Jaipuria Model United Nations was the first of its
                kind in Uttar Pradesh, setting a precedent. What began as a small event in 2013 is ready to manifest
                itself into a grand conference this July. Even the onslaught of Covid-19 could not deter the burning
                spirit of JMUN as it provided the delegates with an opportunity to Deliberate, Defend and Deliver
                virtually by conducting a successful online conference in 2021. This July, we are back with eight
                thought-provoking committees ranging from Lok Sabha to US Committee to Futuristic Security Council.
                The only conference in Uttar Pradesh to simulate a unique committee such as the Global Press Summit
                which allows applicants to act in the capacity of reporters as well as debate over issues of global
                importance. As we embark on this life-changing journey, we request you to come along for the ride
                that lasts three days but is reminisced for years to come. The Secretariat welcomes you all to the
                Tenth Editon of Jaipuria Model United Nations. <br>
                Regards, <br>
                The Secretariat</p>
